##Steps to Building an Effective Team by U.C. Berkeley's People & Culture Office


Effective team leaders build relationships based off of trust and loyalty, not fear and power. Ways to establish trust and loyalty are to treat everyone's ideas as valuable, not sugar-coating things, encourage quiet team members to contribute by reminding them that the team is a judgement free zone and safe space. To avoid acting from a place of power and fear, it is  important to make decisions based off of consensus, establish team values and goals, and and being aware of epople's unspoken feelings and body language. 

It should be a goal to be direct as possible, bit also keeping in mind that while this is the goal, not everyone is comfortable with sharing their true thoughts/wants/needs, so sometimes making inferences based off of people's body language and other signs is needed.
