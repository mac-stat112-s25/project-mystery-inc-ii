## Effective Teamwork Reading

Article read: <https://employer.macildowie.com/blog/the-15-principles-of-building-high-performing-teams>

[**Summary**]{.underline}

I read an article by Macildowie, a recruitment and retention consultancy in the UK titled "The 15 Principles of Building High-Performing Teams." The first section of the article highlighted the importance and benefits of team building.
Some of these benefits included increased productivity, due to greater efficiency and output when working in teams, increased creativity, and stronger abilities to tackle complex challenges effectively when pooling multiple peoples' skills together.

Many of the 15 principles mentioned in the article were related to trust and communication.
For example, principle 1, establishing trust, described trust as the "foundation to any successful team." Trust can be related to having confidence in each others' intentions, capabilities, and reliability, and also allows group members to feel safe taking risks without fear of criticism.
Principle 3, Fostering Open Communication, is also important, since it allows members to share their thoughts, concerns and ideas.
Good communication can relate to other principles mentioned, like celebrating success and supporting members, defining clear roles or responsibilities for group members, regularly sharing expertise, and holding members accountable for their actions or responsibilities.

In my opinion, to create a well-functioning team, building a strong foundation of trust, communication, and accountability is essential.
Practicing all three of these principles in our team will encourage collaboration and cooperation within a team, and let us achieve greater success on our project work.
