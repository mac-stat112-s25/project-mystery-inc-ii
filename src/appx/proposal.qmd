### Title

"Frequency of Common Phrases and Events across Scooby-Doo Episodes"

### Team Members

Adele Fraser, Maria Benito Correa, Sarah Radzilowski

### Description

We will be exploring the Scooby-Doo dataset collected by Kaggle user plummye. We will focus our investigation on the common phrases used in Scooby-Doo episodes across time, as well as how these phrases relate to other events.

### Inspirations 

We found a dataset on Scooby Doo episodes from the TidyTuesday datasets. Since there are so many variables tracked for each episode, including the number of times a phrase was said in an episode. We thought it would be interesting to analyze if there was a relationship between the number of times a phrase was said (ie "Zoinks" or "Jeepers") and events of an episode (ie the type of monster or which character said phrases more often).

### Plan
- Think about the list of deliverables when building the plan.
