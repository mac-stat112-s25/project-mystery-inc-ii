We will focus our investigation on the common phrases used in Scooby-Doo episodes across time, as well as how these phrases relate to other events.\n\nthe reasons/inspirations behind choosing this project\n\nWe found a dataset on Scooby Doo episodes from the TidyTuesday datasets. Since there are so many variables tracked for each episode, including the number of times a phrase was said in an episode. We thought it would be interesting to analyze if there was a relationship between the number of times a phrase was said (ie “Zoinks” or “Jeepers”) and events of an episode (ie the type of monster or which character said phrases more often).\n\na rough implementation and responsibility plan, ie, what needs to be accomplished and who will do what when. Think about the list of deliverables when building the plan. The plan should be presented in a table format.\n\n\n\nWhat?\nWho?\nWhen?\n\n\n\n\nCreate Github Repository\nEveryone\n4/9\n\n\nGroup Project proposal\nEveryone\n4/9\n\n\nCase study\nEveryone\n4/9\n\n\nEffective Teamwork Reading\nEveryone (Independent)\n4/11\n\n\nMotivation\nSarah\n4/11\n\n\nCreate research questions\nEveryone\n4/11\n\n\nBackground\nMaria\n4/14\n\n\nUnderstand/explore the data (following the data questions on project description page)\nEveryone\n4/14\n\n\nWrangle Data for each Question\nAdele\n4/16\n\n\nMake visualizations to answer research questions and apply effective viz principles\nEveryone\n4/18\n\n\nConnect findings back to research questions\nAdele\n4/21\n\n\nLimitations and Future Work\nMaria\n4/21\n\n\nCreate README.md file (requirements on course site)\nEveryone\n4/24\n\n\nWrite report  (requirements on course site)\nEveryone\n4/24\n\n\nMake presentation slideshow\nEveryone\n4/28\n\n\nScript Outline for Presentation\nEveryone\n4/28\n\n\nUse Feedback from Presentation 1\nEveryone (Divided when received)\n5/9\n\n\nFinal Presentation Video\nEveryone\n5/9 (10:30 AM - 12:30 PM)",
