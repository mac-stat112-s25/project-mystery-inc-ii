    "text": "Perfecting Teamwork: Building High-Performing Teams by Encouraging Learning\nBy: Think Fast Talk Smart: Communication Techniques\nLink to Podcast: https://open.spotify.com/episode/7pHpUwOMGOC2FXcikLvySt?si=9336eeaebb7d416f\nSummary:\nI listened to an episode of the Think Fast Talk Smart podcast with guest Sarah Singer, a doctor and medical communication coordinator. Her main requirements for a high-functioning and efficient team were that the group is team-oriented, learning-oriented, and system-oriented. There need to be clear roles in a team and if there is a hierarchy, it needs to be weak and relatively level so that everyone can learn from each other in their areas of expertise. In this vein, people also need to be willing to make mistakes in front of each other and learn from them, no matter their level of seniority in a team. These ideas about hierarchy were very valid in a medical context but apply less to our teamwork in class.\nSpecifically, what I can summarize from this podcast that will help me in class teamwork is communication nuances. One thing that helps a team work well according to the podcast is repeating back what a team member has said to make sure that it is enacted correctly and to help everyone feel heard. This is especially important when learning new techniques and sharing new ideas with each other. I also think that the idea of learning from our mistakes is something that we will be able to do very well and need to focus on in this project, rather than getting too frustrated and bogged down by feeling stuck.",

    "text": "##Steps to Building an Effective Team by U.C. Berkeley’s People & Culture Office\nEffective team leaders build relationships based off of trust and loyalty, not fear and power. Ways to establish trust and loyalty are to treat everyone’s ideas as valuable, not sugar-coating things, encourage quiet team members to contribute by reminding them that the team is a judgement free zone and safe space. To avoid acting from a place of power and fear, it is important to make decisions based off of consensus, establish team values and goals, and and being aware of epople’s unspoken feelings and body language.\nIt should be a goal to be direct as possible, bit also keeping in mind that while this is the goal, not everyone is comfortable with sharing their true thoughts/wants/needs, so sometimes making inferences based off of people’s body language and other signs is needed.",

    "text": "4.1 Effective Teamwork Reading\nArticle read: https://employer.macildowie.com/blog/the-15-principles-of-building-high-performing-teams\nSummary\nI read an article by Macildowie, a recruitment and retention consultancy in the UK titled “The 15 Principles of Building High-Performing Teams.” The first section of the article highlighted the importance and benefits of team building. Some of these benefits included increased productivity, due to greater efficiency and output when working in teams, increased creativity, and stronger abilities to tackle complex challenges effectively when pooling multiple peoples’ skills together.\nMany of the 15 principles mentioned in the article were related to trust and communication. For example, principle 1, establishing trust, described trust as the “foundation to any successful team.” Trust can be related to having confidence in each others’ intentions, capabilities, and reliability, and also allows group members to feel safe taking risks without fear of criticism. Principle 3, Fostering Open Communication, is also important, since it allows members to share their thoughts, concerns and ideas. Good communication can relate to other principles mentioned, like celebrating success and supporting members, defining clear roles or responsibilities for group members, regularly sharing expertise, and holding members accountable for their actions or responsibilities.\nIn my opinion, to create a well-functioning team, building a strong foundation of trust, communication, and accountability is essential. Practicing all three of these principles in our team will encourage collaboration and cooperation within a team, and let us achieve greater success on our project work.",

We will focus our investigation on the common phrases used in Scooby-Doo episodes across time, as well as how these phrases relate to other events.\n\nthe reasons/inspirations behind choosing this project\n\nWe found a dataset on Scooby Doo episodes from the TidyTuesday datasets. Since there are so many variables tracked for each episode, including the number of times a phrase was said in an episode. We thought it would be interesting to analyze if there was a relationship between the number of times a phrase was said (ie “Zoinks” or “Jeepers”) and events of an episode (ie the type of monster or which character said phrases more often).\n\na rough implementation and responsibility plan, ie, what needs to be accomplished and who will do what when.

    "text": "Report referenced: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/six-charts-to-help-americans-understand-the-upcoming-german-election/\nObservations\n“Six Charts To Help Americans Understand The Upcoming German Election” by Anna Hazard starts by providing a short context of why the author created this report.\nThen, the report presents six research questions. The questions start off broad (What are Germans voting on? What are the parties and what do they stand for?) and increasingly become more specific (Who’s in these parties? What is Afd?). At the end of the report, the author proposes and answers some follow-up questions related to the upcoming election (What else should I look out for in this election?).\nEach question is answered by short paragraphs of text followed by a visualization. The report includes a variety of visualizations we have made in class before: maps and scatter plots, and some that we are less familiar with making: tables, charts with organized dots, and more. Most of the visualizations have a title, followed by a one sentence caption. The visualizations are full of color.\nThe report and visualizations also compare German political parties to American political parties. This helps put the numbers into context and better explains the German political party system for an American audience, like the title suggests.",
